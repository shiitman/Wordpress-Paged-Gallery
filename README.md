# Wordpress-Paged-Gallery
This plugin lets you to add a simple pagination to default WP gallery without changing core files. 
May be managed via shortcodes. 
Initial idea found here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23093441/default-wordpress-gallery-pagination 
At the moment is still incompatible with Wordpress Tiled Galleries, so, don't use "paged" in your gallery shortcode if you want a mosaic.
